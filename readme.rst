DOTA2 Team Builder
==================

Introduction
------------

This site is built using the static site generator Jekyll.  This is my first
project to use Jekyll, and I've found it to be very useful and intuitive.

Using Jekyll
-------------

At the most basic, all the need to know is 1) you can generate and serve the
site via::

    jekyll serve

and 2) the generated site will be put into ``_site``, and any files beginning
with an underscore will not be included.

A Deeper Understanding
----------------------

The official quick-start_ guide and this tutorial_ were all I needed to feel
comfortable working with Jekyll.

		<h2>The Goal</h2>
		<p>The goal of this tool to help new and intermediate players make wise character choices that help them pick a well-balanced team.  I hope to ultimately improve the quality of pub play.  My goal is to keep the metrics used to only quantifiable/semi-quantifiable data, and to keep the tool as simple and as easy to use as possible.</p>

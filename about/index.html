		<h2>About the DOTA2 Team Builder</h2>
				<p>I've been playing DOTA2 for about 300 hours.  Normally, this would feel like a lot, but as deep as the game is I still feel like I have a lot to learn.  I wanted to build this tool to help both myself as well as others and give them a nice shift+tab guide that helped them pick a well-balanced team.</p>
				<p>The problem is I'm still not sure what makes up a good team.  There are a number of rules that are used on this site to generate advice, but they're almost guaranteed to be inadequate or downright inaccurate.  That's where you (hopefully) come in.</p>
				<h2>How you can help</h2>
				<p>I need advanced and expert players to help me refine the rules of this team builder.  No coding knowledge is needed (though if you are a frontend person and want to make it look prettier, please let me know).</p>
				<p>I primarily need people who can <span class="text-success"><strong>1)</strong> help refine the individual hero role rankings; and <strong>2)</strong> help refine the algorithms that determine what advice to give.</span></p>
				<p>If you are interested, please send me an email at [ellisd23] at [gmail] [dot] [com].  If you have a dotabuff account or some other credentials to show that you are experienced, please send that along as well.</p>
				<p>I hope to ultimately improve the quality of pub play by providing a resource that helps players choose their characters more wisely.</p>
